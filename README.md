Many urban development constructions happen on things such as marshlands, swamps, etc. 
Companies are seeking a low real estate price, as the land is generally less money
in order to create a profit through their developments, such as malls and offices. 
However, many times these lands are completely incapable of having any sort of 
development, resulting in billions of dollars being lost, as well as a detriment
to our planet. 

The purpose of this model is to attempt to predict the "buildability" of
certain marsh/swamp land areas, reducing the emissions that a failed project
would create, and saving companies large amounts of money.
